1.	Values - 'hello', -87.8, 6
   	Expressions - *, -, /, +
   
2. 	Variables stores any data in a memory loction whereas String is a data-type.
   	We can store String in a variable but not vice-versa.
   	We can not use numbers, special characters to define variable whereas in String we can use numbers, special characters, etc
  
3. 	Boolean - Boolean data type  consists two built-in values: True or False. In mathematical terms, True = 1 and False = 0.

	String - A String is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quotes or double quotes. It is represent by str class.
	ex - 'Example1' or 'Example2'
	
	Numeric -Numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be Integer, Float Number and Complex Numbers. Ex - int-(1), float-(2.34), complex-(2+4j)
	
4. 	Expression is made up of values, variables, operators and call to functions. Expressions represent a value.


5.	A Statement is an action or a command that does something whereas an Expression is a combination of values, operators and literals which yields something. Expression always evaluate to a value, statement don't. Expressions are part of Statement. Ex. (a+b) is an expression and (out= a+b) is a statement. Also assignment statements, conditional statements, loops, etc are statements.

6.	After running this statement, bacon variable contains 22, because we are not assigning increment value to bacon variable.

7.	Output will be same for both expression - 'spamspamspam'

8.	eggs is valid variable while 100 is not a valid variable because according to python namespace, variable name can only start with a letter or underscore. Numbers are allowed in a variable but not at the beginning.

9.	int(), float(), str()

10.	In the following expression, 99 is not a string type. We can  fix the expression using str(99) instead of 99.
